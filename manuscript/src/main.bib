abstract = {Ensuring occupants' thermal comfort and work performance is one of the primary objectives for building environment conditioning systems. In recent years, there emerged many occupant-orientated technologies aiming to optimize thermal comfort while saving energy. These attempts offered opportunities to move the indoor thermal environment control from the one-fits-all approach toward a new paradigm with occupant-centric merits. A timely review of this emerging field would help to fill the knowledge gap and provide new insights for future research and practice. This study performed a literature review to summarize recent occupant-centric thermal comfort practices following a framework with three themes: sensing, predicting, and controlling. The results show that occupant-centric thermal comfort control has become a hot research topic in recent years. A wide range of variables and data-collecting sensors were utilized to support the concept. Among all the potential variables, occupants' comfort feedback, skin temperature, and air temperature are the top three popular input features for thermal comfort prediction. Using different machine learning algorithms, data-driven thermal comfort models were reported to have a median predicting accuracy of 84{\%} and some of them can predict thermal comfort at a personal level. Cases implementing occupant-centric thermal comfort control strategy were reported to save air-conditioning energy by 22{\%} and improve thermal comfort by 29.1{\%}. These observations from the literature support the prospects of the new thermal comfort paradigm. Additionally, the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field were discussed.},

abstract = {Heat exchange processes between the body and the environment are introduced. The definition of the thermoneutral zone as the ambient temperature range within which body temperature (T b ) regulation is achieved only by nonevaporative processes is explained. Thermoreceptors, thermoregulatory effectors (both physiologic and behavioral), and neural pathways and T b signals that connect receptors and effectors into a thermoregulation system are reviewed. A classification of thermoeffectors is proposed. A consensus concept is presented, according to which the thermoregulation system is organized as a dynamic federation of independent thermoeffector loops. While the activity of each effector is driven by a unique combination of deep (core) and superficial (shell) T b s, the regulated variable of the system can be viewed as a spatially distributed T b with a heavily represented core and a lightly represented shell. Core T b is the main feedback; it is always negative. Shell T b s (mostly of the hairy skin) represent the auxiliary feedback, which can be negative or positive, and which decreases the system's response time and load error. Signals from the glabrous (nonhairy) skin about the temperature of objects in the environment serve as feedforward signals for various behaviors. Physiologic effectors do not use feedforward signals. The system interacts with other homeostatic systems by “meshing” with their loops. Coordination between different thermoeffectors is achieved through the common controlled variable, T b . The term balance point (not set point) is used for a regulated level of T b . The term interthreshold zone is used for a T b range in which no effectors are activated. Thermoregulatory states are classified, based on whether: T b is increased (hyperthermia) or decreased (hypothermia); the interthreshold zone is narrow (homeothermic type of regulation) or wide (poikilothermic type); and the balance point is increased (fever) or decreased (anapyrexia). During fever, thermoregulation can be either homeothermic or poikilothermic; anapyrexia is always a poikilothermic state. The biologic significance of poikilothermic states is discussed. As an example of practical applications of the concept presented, thermopharmacology is reviewed. Thermopharmacology uses drugs to modulate specific temperature signals at the level of a thermoreceptor (transient receptor potential channel).},

abstract = {The common practice of defining operational settings for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings is to use fixed set points, which assume occupants have same and static comfort requirements. However, thermal comfort varies from person to person and also changes due to climatic variations or acclimation, making it dynamic. In addition, thermal comfort in transient conditions are different from the steady state conditions, which makes the prediction of thermal comfort more difficult. Thus, thermal comfort has to be monitored over time. In this paper, we present a novel infrared thermography based technique to monitor an individual's thermoregulation performance and thermal comfort levels by measuring the skin temperature on several points on human face, which has a high density of blood vessels and is not usually covered by clothing. Unlike other methods, our method requires no continuous user input or interaction. Our results demonstrate that the monitored facial points behave differently under the heat and cold stresses and it can be explained based on the underlying vascular territories. We define two heuristics to describe the thermoneutral zone based on the observed behaviors and estimate thermal comfort for individuals with 95{\%} confidence level. Considerable variations are observed in the thermoregulation performance and uncomfortably cool conditions metrics between the males and females. Females' thermoregulation system responses are less sensitive to the perception of warm conditions. However, similar behaviors are observed for uncomfortably cool conditions across genders.},

abstract = {Much attention was paid on human centered design strategies for environmental control systems of indoor built environments. The goal is to achieve thermally comfortable, healthy and safe working or living environments in energy efficient manners. Normally building Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems have fixed operating settings, which can't satisfy human thermal comfort requirements under transient and non-uniform indoor thermal environments. Therefore, human thermal physiology signal such as skin temperature, which can reflect human body thermal sensation, has to be measured over time. Several trials have been performed by minimizing measuring sensors such as i-Button and mounting measuring sensors into wearable devices such as glasses. Infrared thermography technology has also been tried to achieve non-invasive measurements. However, it would be much more convenient and feasible if normal computer camera could record images, which could be used to obtain human thermal physiology signals. In this study, skin temperature of hand back, which has a high density of blood vessels and is normally not covered by clothing, was measured by i-button sensors. Images recorded by normal camera were amplified to analyzing skin temperature variation, which are impossible to see with naked eyes. The agreement between i-button sensor measuring results and image magnification results demonstrated the possibility of non-invasive measuring technology by image magnification. Partly personalized saturation-temperature model (T = 96.5 × S + bi) can be used to predict skin temperatures for young East Asia females.},

abstract = {A personal comfort model is an approach to thermal comfort modeling, for thermal environmental design and control, that predicts an individual's thermal comfort response, instead of the average response of a large population. We developed personal thermal comfort models using lab grade wearable in normal daily activities. We collected physiological signals (e.g., skin temperature, heart rate) of 14 subjects (6 female and 8 male adults) and environmental parameters (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity) for 2-4 weeks (at least 20 hours per day). Then we trained 14 models for each subject with different machine-learning algorithms to predict their thermal preference. The results show that the median prediction power could be up to 24{\%} /78{\%} /0.79 (Cohen's kappa/accuracy/AUC) with all features considered. The median prediction power reaches 21{\%} /71{\%} /0.7 after 200 subjective votes. We explored the importance of different features on the prediction performance by considering all subjects in one dataset. When all features included for the entire dataset, personal comfort models can generate the highest performance of 35{\%} /76{\%} /0.80 by the most predictive algorithm. Personal comfort models display the highest prediction power when occupants' thermal sensations is outside thermal neutrality. Skin temperature measured at the ankle is more predictive than measured at the wrist. We suggest that Cohen's kappa or AUC should be employed to assess the performance of personal thermal comfort models for imbalanced datasets due to the capacity to exclude random success.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore how the human body adapts to an environment as the temperature changes, and to describe the relationship between the objective skin temperature and subjective thermal evaluation. The influence of short-term thermal experience, which based on minutes and hours scale, could be considered on the prediction of thermal sensation. Usually, the indoor temperature set point is close to neutral, in which state the heat transfer between environment and human body is at a low level. Therefore, we mainly focused on the changes from non-neutral to neutral, to observe the effects of thermal experience in neutral environment. A chamber experiment was conducted with 20 subjects and used five conditions. The control group was maintained at 26 °C. The other conditions consisted of two phases in which subjects were exposed to a hot or cold temperature for a period of time and then go into a 26 °C room, which is considered a neutral environment. We measured the skin temperature on the chest, upper arm, and lower limb. The subjects were asked to complete thermal evaluation questionnaires about thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and thermal acceptance. The skin temperature of subjects varied for the different conditions. We found that even if a poor thermal environment was improved slightly, the thermal satisfaction of subjects increased significantly. This study describes two methods for the prediction of thermal sensation, and the results contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of adaptive thermal comfort.},

The air temperature of the high-level heat exposure stage was 37 °C while the low-level temperatures were 22/26/32 °C, thus developing large (C15: 22 °C–37 °C–22 °C), medium (C11: 26 °C–37 °C–26 °C) and small (C5: 32 °C–37 °C–32 °C) step-change conditions. Twenty four healthy subjects were recruited with skin temperatures of seven local body parts sampled. In addition, self-reported symptoms and thermal perceptions including thermal sensation, comfort and acceptability were investigated. Results show asymmetry in overall and local thermal sensation with overall and local $\Delta$TSV after down-steps in C5 and C15 being significantly larger than their counterparts after up-steps. The most sensitive parts are back, arm and leg. Besides, overall thermal sensation change is more intensive than that of any of other local thermal sensations. In the large step-change condition C15, instep temperature contributed most to the fact that more than 45 min was needed for mean skin temperature to achieve steady after down-step.},

abstract = {Objective: Changes in core body temperature due to heat transfer through the skin have a major influence on sleep regulation. Traditional measures of skin temperature are often complicated by extensive wiring and are not practical for use in normal living conditions. This review describes studies examining the reliability, validity and utility of the iButton{\textregistered}, a wireless peripheral thermometry device, in sleep/wake research. Methods: A review was conducted of English language literature on the iButton as a measure of circadian body temperature rhythms associated with the sleep/wake cycle. Results: Seven studies of the iButtton as a measure of human body temperature were included. The iButton was found to be a reliable and valid measure of body temperature. Its application to human skin was shown to be comfortable and tolerable with no significant adverse reactions. Distal skin temperatures were negatively correlated with sleep/wake activity, and the temperature gradient between the distal and proximal skin (DPG) was identified as an accurate physiological correlate of sleep propensity. Methodological issues included site of data logger placement, temperature masking factors, and temperature data analysis. Conclusions: The iButton is an inexpensive, wireless data logger that can be used to obtain a valid measurement of human skin temperature. It is a practical alternative to traditional measures of circadian rhythms in sleep/wake research. Further research is needed to determine the utility of the iButton in vulnerable populations, including those with neurodegenerative disorders and memory impairment and pediatric populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Current thermal/sensation models primarily rely on predefined formulas or empirically defined recommendations, but fail to consider each individual's physiological characteristics. Such models frequently ignore occupants' diverse physical conditions and, therefore, have critical limitations in estimating each individual's thermal sensation levels. Since the human body is governed by the thermoregulation principle to balance the heat flux between the ambient thermal condition and the body itself, skin temperature has a significant role in maintaining this physiological principle. Therefore, this study investigated the potential use of skin temperature and its technical parameters in establishing a thermal sensation. By using advanced modern sensing technologies, and existing thermal regulation model research, this study selected and validated seven body areas as significant local body segments for determining overall thermal sensation. A series of environmental chamber tests were conducted for 2 h. While the indoor temperature fluctuated between 20 °C and 30 °C, skin temperatures of the seven selected body areas were measured in conjunction with a thermal sensation and comfort survey. Results of this study revealed that combinations of skin temperatures for the arm, back, and wrist provided the significant information needed to accurately estimate the thermal sensations of each user. Most of all, both sides of the wrist generated accurate data more than 94{\%} of the time. Therefore, considering the modern advanced wearable sensing technologies, results of this study confirmed that optimum combinations of skin temperature information from selected body areas, is reliable and generally applicable for estimating individual thermal sensations.},

Therefore, this research has relied on experiments using human subjects in an environmental chamber to investigate and determine how skin temperatures change, depending on the ambient thermal conditions, and to identify which data type and body segment generate the most significant physiological information that will represent the overall thermal sensation.For this study, the experiments were conducted with 26 volunteers in an experimental chamber for about 2. h each, while the indoor temperature was changed from 20. °C to 30. °C. Results of this study revealed that skin temperature change rates (gradients) were more consistent with the thermal comfort condition than with the actual levels of skin temperatures of participants, and that the measured skin temperatures at their wrists provided more interpretable data than that of any other body segments. Therefore, the research findings have shown the potential of skin temperature as a thermal sensation index to reliably represent an individual's thermal sensation in a thermally uniformed environment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {About 40{\%} of the energy produced globally is consumed within buildings, primarily for providing occupants with comfortable work and living spaces. However, despite the significant impacts of such energy consumption on the environment, the lack of thermal comfort among occupants is a common problem that can lead to health complications and reduced productivity. To address this problem, it is particularly important to understand occupants' thermal comfort in real-time to dynamically control the environment. This study investigates an infrared thermal camera network to extract skin temperature features and predict occupants' thermal preferences at flexible distances and angles. This study distinguishes from existing methods in two ways: (1) the proposed method is a non-intrusive data collection approach which does not require human participation or personal devices; (2) it uses low-cost thermal cameras and RGB-D sensors which can be rapidly reconfigured to adapt to various settings and has little or no hardware infrastructure dependency. The proposed camera network is verified using the facial skin temperature collected from 16 subjects in a multi-occupancy experiment. The results show that all 16 subjects observed a statistically higher skin temperature as the room temperature increases. The variations in skin temperature also correspond to the distinct comfort states reported by the subjects. The post-experiment evaluation suggests that the networked thermal cameras have a minimal interruption of building occupants. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential to transition the human physiological data collection from an intrusive and wearable device-based approach to a truly non-intrusive and scalable approach.},

abstract = {This work evaluated the use of thermographic cameras as a non-invasive method to automatically model human thermal comfort in transient conditions, using data from 30 healthy subjects tested in an office setup with ambient temperatures between 21.11 °C and 27.78 °C. Office temperature, relative humidity, exposed skin temperature and clothing temperature were automatically measured over approximately 27 min per subject, using remote sensors and avoiding any contact with the subjects. Thermal comfort levels were evaluated using subjects feedback, recorded every minute for the entire experiment. Clothing insulation and metabolic rate were kept relatively constant for this experiment (0.54 clo and 1.1 met). Average skin temperature was extracted from five different locations, with average temperatures of 33.5 °C, 34.5 °C, and 35.6 °C corresponding to cold discomfort, comfort and warm discomfort respectively. Average clothing temperature was also extracted from three different location, with 32.3 °C, 33.8 °C and 35.0 °C corresponding to the same three comfort levels. Relative humidity levels were similar for all subjects, with average values between 38{\%} and 33{\%}. Results showed significant correlation between observed skin temperature, clothing temperature and thermal comfort level. Also, collected data showed that the temperature difference between different body locations was highly correlated with thermal comfort, and the variance of skin temperature over a small area was significantly correlated with thermal comfort. The results suggest that non-invasive thermographic cameras that combine visual and thermal modes are sufficiently accurate in real-world settings to drive control of HVAC systems.},

abstract = {Predicting building occupants' thermal comfort via machine learning (ML) is a hot research topic. Many algorithms and data processing methods have been applied to predict thermal comfort indices in different contexts. But few studies have systematically investigated how different algorithms and data processing methods can influence the prediction accuracy. In this study, we first summarized the recent literature from perspectives of predicted comfort indices, algorithms applied, input features, data sources, sample size, training proportion, predicting accuracy, etc. Then, we applied nine ML algorithms and three data sampling methods to predict the 3-point and 7-point thermal sensation vote (TSV) in ASHRAE Comfort Database II. The results show that with an accuracy of 66.3{\%} and 61.1{\%} for 3-point and 7-point TSV respectively, Random Forest (RF) has the best performance among the tested algorithms. Compared to the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model, ML TSV models generally have higher accuracy in TSV prediction. Based on feature importance analysis, the air temperature, humidity, clothing, air velocity, age, and metabolic rate are the top six important features for TSV prediction. The RF algorithm can achieve 63.6{\%} overall accuracy in TSV prediction with the top three features, which is only 2.6{\%} lower than involving 12 input features. Further, this paper addressed other common considerations in ML comfort model establishment such as tuning hyperparameters, splitting of training and testing data, and encoding methods. We also provided Python and R programming codes and packages as appendixes, which can be a good reference for future studies.},

   abstract = {The predicted mean vote (PMV) model of thermal comfort, created by Fanger in the late 1960s, is used worldwide to assess thermal comfort. Fanger based his model on college-aged students for use in invariant environmental conditions in air-conditioned buildings in moderate thermal climate zones. Environmental engineering practice calls for a predictive method that is applicable to all types of people in any kind of building in every climate zone. In this publication, existing support and criticism, as well as modifications to the PMV model are discussed in light of the requirements by environmental engineering practice in the 21st century in order to move from a predicted mean vote to comfort for all. Improved prediction of thermal comfort can be achieved through improving the validity of the PMV model, better specification of the model's input parameters, and accounting for outdoor thermal conditions and special groups. The application range of the PMV model can be enlarged, for instance, by using the model to assess the effects of the thermal environment on productivity and behavior, and interactions with other indoor environmental parameters, and the use of information and communication technologies. Even with such modifications to thermal comfort evaluation, thermal comfort for all can only be achieved when occupants have effective control over their own thermal environment.\r\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The paper treats the assessment of thermal comfort using the PMV model of Fanger, and deals with the strengths and limitations of this model. Readers are made familiar to some opportunities for use in the 21st-century information society.},

   abstract = {While there are plenty of anecdotal experiences of overcooled buildings in summer, evidence from field studies suggests that there is indeed an issue of overcooling in tropical buildings. The findings suggest that overcooled buildings are not a consequence of occupant preference but more like an outcome of the HVAC system design and operation. Occupants' adaptation in overcooled indoor environments through additional clothing cannot be regarded as an effective mitigating strategy for cold thermal discomfort. In the last two decades or so, several field studies and field environmental chamber studies in the tropics provided evidence for occupants' preference for a warmer temperature with adaptation methods such as elevated air speeds. It is important to bear in mind that indoor humidity levels are not compromised as they could have an impact on the inhaled air condition that could eventually affect perceived air quality. This review article has attempted to track significant developments in our understanding of the thermal comfort issues in air-conditioned office and educational buildings in hot and humid climates in the last 25 years, primarily on occupant preference for thermal comfort in such climates. The issue of overcooled buildings, by design intent or otherwise, is discussed in some detail. Finally, the article has explored some viable adaptive thermal comfort options that show considerable promise for not only improving thermal comfort in tropical buildings but are also energy efficient and could be seen as sustainable solutions.},

    abstract = {Measurements of skin temperatures are often complicated because of the use of wired sensors. This is so in field studies, but also holds for many laboratory conditions. This article describes a wireless temperature system for human skin temperature measurements, i.e. the Thermochron iButton DS1291H. The study deals with validation of the iButton and its application on the human skin, and describes clinical and field measurements. The validation study shows that iButtons have a mean accuracy of - 0.09 °C (- 0.4 °C at most) with a precision of 0.05 °C (0.09 °C at most). These properties can be improved by using calibration. Due to the size of the device the response time is longer than that of conventional sensors, with a $\tau$ in water of 19 s. On the human skin under transient conditions the response time is significantly longer, revealing momentary deviations with a magnitude of 1 °C. The use of iButtons has been described in studies on circadian rhythms, sleep and cardiac surgery. With respect to circadian rhythm and sleep research, skin temperature assessment by iButtons is of significant value in laboratory, clinical and home situations. We demonstrate that differences in laboratory and field measurements add to our understanding of thermophysiology under natural living conditions. The advantage of iButtons in surgery research is that they are easy to sterilize and wireless so that they do not hinder the surgical procedure. In conclusion, the application of iButtons is advantageous for measuring skin temperatures in those situations in which wired instruments are unpractical and fast responses are not required. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We assessed the difference between mean radiant temperature (tr¯) and air temperature (ta) in conditioned office buildings to provide guidance on whether practitioners should separately measure tr¯ or operative temperature to control heating and cooling systems. We used measurements from 48 office buildings in the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database, five field studies in radiant and all-air buildings, and five test conditions from a laboratory experiment that compared radiant and all-air cooling. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database is the largest of these three datasets and most representative of typical thermal conditions in an office; in this dataset the median absolute difference between tr¯ and ta was 0.4 ∘C (with 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles = 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 1.6 °C). More specifically, the median difference shows that tr¯ was 0.4 ∘C warmer than ta (with 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles = -0.4 °C, 0.2 °C, 0.6 °C, and 1.6 °C). The laboratory experiments revealed that in a radiant cooled space tr¯ was significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) cooler than ta (average difference −0.1 ∘C), while in the all-air cooled space tr¯ was significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) warmer than ta (average difference +0.3 ∘C). These observations indicate that tr¯ and ta are typically closer in radiant cooled spaces than in all-air cooled spaces. Although the differences are significant, the effect sizes are negligible to small based on Cohen's d and Spearman's rho. Therefore, we conclude that measurement of ta is sufficient to estimate tr¯ under typical office conditions, and that separate measurement of tr¯ or operative temperature is not likely to have practical benefits to thermal comfort in most cases – this is especially true for buildings with radiant systems. Furthermore, spatial and temporal variations in ta can be greater than or equal to the difference between tr¯ and ta at any one location in a thermal zone, thus we expect that such variations typically have a greater impact on occupant thermal comfort than the differences between tr¯ and ta.},

    abstract = {A personal comfort model is a new approach to thermal comfort modeling that predicts individuals' thermal comfort responses, instead of the average response of a large population. However, securing consistent occupant feedback for model development is challenging as the current methods of data collection rely on individuals' survey participation. We explored the use of a new type of feedback, occupants' heating and cooling behavior with a personal comfort system (PCS) for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals' thermal preference. The model development draws from field data including PCS control behavior, environmental conditions and mechanical system settings collected from 38 occupants in an office building, and employs six machine learning algorithms. The results showed that (1) personal comfort models based on all field data produced the median accuracy of 0.73 among all subjects and improved predictive accuracy compared to conventional models (PMV, adaptive) which produced a median accuracy of 0.51; (2) the PMV and adaptive models produced individual comfort predictions only slightly better than random guessing under the relatively mild indoor environment observed in the field study; and (3) the models based on PCS control behavior produced the best prediction accuracy when individually assessing all categories of field data acquired in the study. We conclude that personal comfort models based on occupants' heating and cooling behavior can effectively predict individuals' thermal preference and can therefore be used in everyday comfort management to improve occupant satisfaction and energy use in buildings.},

    abstract = {The predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) are the most widely used thermal comfort indices. Yet, their performance remains a contested topic. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II, the largest of its kind, was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the PMV/PPD model. We focused on: (i) the accuracy of PMV in predicting both observed thermal sensation (OTS) or observed mean vote (OMV) and (ii) comparing the PMV-PPD relationship with binned OTS – observed percentage of unacceptability (OPU). The accuracy of PMV in predicting OTS was only 34 {\%} , meaning that the thermal sensation is incorrectly predicted two out of three times. PMV had a mean absolute error of one unit on the thermal sensation scale and its accuracy decreased towards the ends of the thermal sensation scale. The accuracy of PMV was similarly low for air-conditioned, naturally ventilated and mixed-mode buildings. In addition, the PPD was not able to predict the dissatisfaction rate. If the PMV model would perfectly predict thermal sensation, then PPD accuracy is higher close to neutrality but it would overestimate dissatisfaction by approximately 15–25 {\%} outside of it. Furthermore, PMV-PPD accuracy varied strongly between ventilation strategies, building types and climate groups. These findings demonstrate the low prediction accuracy of the PMV–PPD model, indicating the need to develop high prediction accuracy thermal comfort models. For demonstration, we developed a simple thermal prediction model just based on air temperature and its accuracy, for this database, was higher than PMV.},

The acquisition of labelled data however remains a challenge. This paper presents a methodology for the collection of in-situ occupant feedback data using a Fitbit smartwatch. The clock-face application cozie can be downloaded free-of-charge on the Fitbit store and tailored to fit a range of occupant comfort related experiments. In the initial trial of the app, fifteen users were given a smartwatch for one month and were prompted to give feedback on their thermal preferences. In one month, with minimal administrative overhead, 1460 labelled responses were collected. This paper demonstrates how these large data sets of human feedback can be analysed to reveal a range of results from building anomalies, occupant behaviour, occupant personality clustering, and general feedback related to the building. The paper also discusses limitations in the approach and the next phase of design of the platform.},

Temperature data from the cabin mockup, as measured by thermocouples, were analyzed using statistical methods for elucidation of the turbulence characteristics of the thermal plumes of manikins. The characteristics of the thermal plumes are illustrated by the skewness factors of the temperature signal. The results indicate the characteristics of the thermal plume from the torso differ from those from the thigh. A thin layer (approximately 5 mm) of the thermal plume was observed around the human torso. Further, thermal plumes were more fully developed at the thigh than the torso. The results contribute to the understanding of airflow patterns influenced by thermal plumes near the head, chest, abdomen and thigh.},

              personalized thermal preference profiles, by formulating a
              combined classification and inference problem, without developing
              different models for each occupant. Different from existing
              approaches, we developed a generalized thermal preference model
              in which our main hypothesis, ``Different people prefer different
              thermal conditions'', is explicitly encoded. The approach is
              fully Bayesian, and it is based on the premise that the thermal
              preference is mainly governed by (i) an overall thermal stress,
              represented using physical process equations with relatively few
              parameters along with prior knowledge of the parameters, and (ii)
              the personal thermal preference characteristic, which is modeled
              as a hidden random variable. The concept of clustering occupants
              based on this hidden variable, i.e., similar thermal preference
              characteristic, is introduced. The results, based on a dataset
              collected from a typical office building population, show clear
              evidence of the existence of multi-clusters; in particular, the
              5-cluster model performed best compared to 2, 3 and higher
              cluster models using the studied dataset. Subsequently, the
              thermal preference of a new occupant in the dataset is inferred
              by using a mixture of the general sub-models for each cluster.
              The results show that the method developed in this study provides

              personalized comfort models which can be interpreted to determine
              optimal temperature setpoints based on energy and comfort goals.

              comfort models that predict individuals' thermal comfort
              responses. Currently, thermal comfort responses are collected
              from the occupants via survey. This study explored if the thermal
              comfort of individuals could be predicted using machine learning
              algorithms while relaying on the set of collected inputs from an
              experiment. The model was developed using experimental data
              including collected from a previously performed experiment in the
              climate chamber. Two different approaches based on the output
              data (thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes) and five
              different sets of input variables were explored. The algorithms
              tested were Support Vector Machine with four different Kernel
              functions (Linear, Quadratic, Cubic and Gaussian) and Ensemble
              Algorithms (Boosted trees, Bagged trees and RUSBoosted trees).
              The combination of occupants' heating behavior with a personal
              comfort system (PCS), skin temperatures, time and environmental
              data were used for the development of personal comfort models to
              predict individuals' thermal preference. The study investigated
              the novel combination of inputs such as the use of skin
              temperature and settings of the personalized heating system as
              parameters in predicting personal thermal comfort. The results
              showed that personal comfort models among all tested approaches

              control behavior and mean and hand skin temperatures produced the
              best prediction accuracy when assessing all tested algorithms.

              comfortable conditions and furthermore enabling control
              approaches in accordance with occupants' preferences. Most
              comfort models target the representation of an average sensation
              of all occupants. However, in large office spaces, the thermal
              sensation can vary significantly between the occupants and
              averaged comfort predictions do not necessarily represent the
              individual preferences. To allow for customized thermal
              conditions, user feedback is collected in daily working routine
              and used for the development of a personalized comfort prediction
              model. Furthermore, the presented approach takes into account the
              effect of increased air movement to enable customized conditions.
              Individual comfort models are derived for each user based on a
              hybrid approach: The widely used predicted mean vote (PMV) is
              used as a starting point and evaluated for the given voting data.
              Based on this analysis, the proposed comfort model is composed of
              a polynomial basis function extended by a Gaussian Process
              regression model to capture the complex and highly subjective
              relations between room conditions and thermal perception. An
              analysis of the significance of all measured variables is
              performed to reduce the model's complexity by selecting the most
              impacting parameters. This approach allows for a 74\% higher
              individual prediction accuracy compared to the standard PMV
              calculation.",

               more available to analysts and researchers due to the
               proliferation of sensors and subjective feedback methods. These
               data can be used for modeling comfort behavior to support design
               and operations towards energy efficiency and well-being. By
               nature, occupant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor
               conditions are designed for comfort, and responses indicating
               otherwise are less common. This situation creates a scenario for
               the machine learning workflow where class balancing as a
               pre-processing step might be valuable for developing predictive
               thermal comfort classification models with high-performance.
               This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset
               class balancing techniques from the literature and proposes a
               modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),
               comfortGAN, to address this imbalance scenario. These approaches
               are applied to three publicly available datasets, ranging from
               30 and 67 participants to a global collection of thermal comfort
               datasets, with 1,474; 2,067; and 66,397 data points,
               respectively. This work finds that a classification model
               trained on a balanced dataset, comprised of real and generated
               samples from comfortGAN, has higher performance (increase
               between 4\% and 17\% in classification accuracy) than other
               augmentation methods tested. However, when classes representing
               discomfort are merged and reduced to three, better imbalanced
               performance is expected, and the additional increase in
               performance by comfortGAN shrinks to 1--2\%. These results
               illustrate that class balancing for thermal comfort modeling is
               beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its value
               is diminished in certain scenarios. A discussion is provided to
               assist potential users in determining which scenarios this

               The occupants and the spaces in which they left feedback were
